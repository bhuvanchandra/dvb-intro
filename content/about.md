Iâ€™m interested in electronics, robotics, physics, bicycle trekking, music, drawing
and pet-keeping. I was also a member in [Scout](http://www.bsgindia.org/) during
my school days, we as a troop did volunteer work during our school events.
I have always been good at sports. I like playing volley ball, basket ball and
running. I have played in few sports tournaments (volleyball, races) together
with my team.

Computers first appered in my life when I was seven, we used M$-DOS
[Logo] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)#Turtle_and_graphics)
programming language. It was interesting playing around with the commands and
making some crazy shapes. I remember M$-DOS OS loaded via floppy disk by our
instructor. I also used to observe the technical support team from intel used to
come for installing the mother boards for new PCs in our labs, there seeded my
interest in electronics, I was curious since that time on understanding them.
Later during our school days I did few small projects and demonstrated at state
level science fairs. My father helped me very much in understanding the working
principles of a DC motor etc.

I had got my first computer during my college as a token of my efforts of maintaing
(s/w installations and n/w tools) at a small internet cafe near our College. It
was an old Intel Pentium II processor with 128MB RAM with a 14" CRT monitor and
PS3 Key board and actual ball mouse. It was the first time I tried Linux OS(Ubuntu),
during initial days of ubutnu release users can register for Ubuntu installer CDs,
my brother helped me to get and I installed on my PC, played around package manager,
browser and command line and scritps. This is the time I fell in love with Linux
and since then I used M$ only to play games, (only until [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about/)) ;)

While doing mini projects I got my first laptop, and started my hands-on with C programming language in Keil for 8051 MCUs. I did my first mini project interfacing a RC module and controlling a two wheeled robot remotely. My main project is automated pick and place bot which uses a RGB color sensor which scans and picks objects with particular colors. After this we went to some workshops at NITK Mangalore where we got introduced to AVR platform with a robot kit which does line following, obstacle avoiding and UART based motor control etc.

This trigged my interest into Embedded systems and later I did a Embedded Systems
Design at CDAC, where we got introduced with latest technologies and learned Linux
device drivers and Linux System programming.

Later I got an opportunity as Trainee Enginner at [Toradex](https://www.toradex.com),
where I'm currently working as Embedded Linux Develoment Engineer since 2013.

I work on Linux Kernel/BSP Development for [Toradex Apalis/Colibri](https://www.toradex.com/products) [Computer on Modules](https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules).
Did some upstream contributions too in
[Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=bhuvanchandra.dv) and
[U-Boot](http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git&a=search&h=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster&st=author&s=bhuvanchandra.dv).
