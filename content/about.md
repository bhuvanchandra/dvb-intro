I have a multifaceted interest in electronics, robotics, physics, bicycle trekking, music, drawing, and pet-keeping. In my school days, I was an active member of the Scouts, where our troop engaged in volunteer work during school events. My penchant for sports has always been evident, with a particular fondness for volleyball, basketball, and running, even participating in numerous sports tournaments with my team.

Computers entered my life at the age of seven, initially navigating through the M$-DOS Logo programming language. Playing with commands and generating various shapes was fascinating. Observing the M$-DOS OS being loaded via floppy disk by our instructor and watching Intel's technical support team install motherboards in our labs piqued my interest in electronics. This curiosity extended throughout my school days, embarking on small projects and presenting them at state-level science fairs, with my father guiding me through the intricacies of components like DC motors.

I acquired my first computer, an Intel Pentium II processor with 128MB RAM, a 14” CRT monitor, a PS3 Keyboard, and a ball mouse, as a token of appreciation for maintaining software installations and network tools at a local internet café during college. It was with this computer that I explored the Linux OS (Ubuntu), immersing myself in the package manager, browser, command line, and scripts. This foray amplified my love for Linux, which eventually became my OS of choice, restricting my use of M$ to gaming (until Steam came along).

During my mini-projects, I utilized my first laptop and began exploring the C programming language in Keil for 8051 MCUs. My first mini-project involved interfacing an RC module and remotely controlling a two-wheeled robot. Following this, my main project was an automated pick-and-place bot that utilized an RGB color sensor to identify, pick, and place objects based on color. We also attended workshops at NITK Mangalore, where we were introduced to the AVR platform and a robot kit that featured line following, obstacle avoidance, and UART-based motor control.

This fuelled my interest in Embedded Systems, prompting me to undertake a course in Embedded Systems Design at CDAC, where I was introduced to the latest technologies and learned about Linux device drivers and Linux System programming.

My professional journey began at Toradex, where I worked until 2018. Afterward, I joined Rapyuta Robotics in Bangalore, spending a year there before relocating to Rapyuta Robotics in Tokyo. Currently, I am employed as a Senior Embedded Systems Engineer, contributing to various innovative projects and enhancing my expertise in the domain.

I work on Linux Kernel/BSP Development for [Toradex Apalis/Colibri](https://www.toradex.com/products) [Computer on Modules](https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules).
Did some upstream contributions too in
[Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=bhuvanchandra.dv) and
[U-Boot](http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git&a=search&h=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster&st=author&s=bhuvanchandra.dv).
